Creating a panorama is a popular technique in photography and image processing used to capture images with a horizontally elongated field of view. It involves stitching together multiple photographs taken from the same point but at different angles to create a single, wide-field image. This technique is commonly used to capture landscapes, cityscapes, and other broad scenes that cannot be captured in a single frame due to their size.

This projects explores the use of surf and images to compute a panorama. The Panorama leverages the powerful SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) algorithm to stitch multiple overlapping photographs into a seamless panoramic image. This tool is designed for high accuracy in feature detection and alignment, making it ideal for creating high-quality panoramic images even in complex scenes with varying textures and lighting conditions.
